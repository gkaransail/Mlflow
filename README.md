MLflow: A Platform for Managing the Machine Learning Lifecycle
MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. It provides tools for tracking experiments, packaging and sharing code, managing models, and deploying them to various environments.

This repository contains the core components of MLflow.

Overview
MLflow helps you streamline and scale your machine learning workflows. It offers a simple interface for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible environments, and deploying machine learning models into production.

Key Capabilities:
Experiment Tracking: Log, query, and visualize model parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
Model Packaging: Package models in a standardized format for portability and reuse.
Model Registry: Centralized repository for managing the lifecycle of models (versioning, staging, and production).
Model Deployment: Simplify the deployment of machine learning models to different platforms (local, cloud, etc.).
Framework Compatibility: Works with popular ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
Key Features
Experiment Tracking: Track and log the metrics, parameters, and artifacts of machine learning experiments.
Model Registry: Manage models, including versioning, approval stages (e.g., Staging, Production), and dependencies.
Web Interface: Provides an interactive UI to monitor and compare experiments, models, and metrics.
Deployment: Quickly deploy models to different environments (e.g., local, cloud, etc.).
Integration with ML Frameworks: Integrates with various ML libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and more.
APIs for Integration: Available in Python, R, Java, and REST APIs.
Getting Started
To use MLflow, you can start by running it locally or on a server to experiment with your models. Below is a simple walkthrough on getting started.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+ (recommended)
