MLflow Project
This repository contains an MLflow-based project that aims to demonstrate the workflow for tracking machine learning experiments, managing models, and deploying them in a streamlined manner.

Overview
MLflow is an open-source platform to manage the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This project integrates MLflow to:

1) Track experiments, metrics, and parameters.
2) Organize and manage machine learning models.
3) Deploy models in various environments (e.g., local, cloud, or production systems).
